# GameBrowser
A program to browse your games (or programs) and monitor their performance and usage. All this using less resources than traditional programs.

## Installation
You will need Python3+ and pip installed.

First, install teh python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also install the additional dependencies:
```
pip install -r additional-requirements.txt
```

Then, you can start the app:
```
python main.pyw
```

You should create a Windows shortcut (maybe using the app icon ?) to launch the `main.pyw` file. You should use pythonw instead of python (hence the '.pyw' file extension).
